Hello ~ I am Haimeng Zhao (赵海萌), an undergraduate of Physics at [Zhili College, Tsinghua University](https://www.zlc.tsinghua.edu.cn).
I'm deeply fascinated by how the universe works and how we can possibly understand it.
So I started working in the intersection of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

Specifically, my interest comes in two folds:

- the foundation, application and interplay of quantum physics, information theory and statistics;
- (quantum) machine learning for physics and physics for machine learning.
