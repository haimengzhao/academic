Hello ~ I'm Haimeng Zhao (赵海萌), a PhD student in Physics at Caltech.
I'm deeply fascinated by how the universe works and how we can possibly understand it.
So I started working in the intersection of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

In particular, I'm interested in the foundation, applications and interplay of quantum physics, information theory and high-dimensional statistics. The emerging, unifying theme among quantum information, condensed matter and high energy physics also excites me.

Before Caltech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics with Honours from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I was an undergrad research fellow in [John Preskill's group](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) at [IQIM, Caltech](https://iqim.caltech.edu) and an exchange student in [Giuseppe Carleo's group](https://people.epfl.ch/giuseppe.carleo?lang=en) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland. Before that, I worked on AI for Astronomy with [Wei Zhu](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~wzhu/) at Tsinghua.
